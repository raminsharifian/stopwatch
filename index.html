      <h1>Stopwatch Guide</h1>
      <p>Welcome to the Stopwatch App!</p>
      <p>
        This application allows you to control a stopwatch with the following
        features:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Start/Pause:</strong> Click the stopwatch or press "Space" or
          "P" to toggle between start and pause.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Reset:</strong> Press the "R" key to reset the stopwatch.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Automatic State Saving:</strong> Your stopwatch's state is
          saved automatically in the browser's localStorage, so it persists even
          when you refresh the page.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Follow the instructions to use the stopwatch efficiently. Happy timing!
